  "address": "123 Main St, City, ST 12345",

MAG (Mandar) - Voice AI Script
Task: Write the conversation script for the voice AI.
Questions to answer:
1.	What should the AI ask sellers? (e.g., "Why are you selling?")
2.	What responses qualify a lead? (motivated seller vs tire-kicker)
3.	How do we score them? (1-10 scale? Yes/no qualified?)
Format: Simple bullet list or flowchart is fine.
Reference: Check STATUS.md â†’ "Voice AI Integration (Pending)" for context.
 
Mihir - Dashboard Polish
Task: Dashboard is done! If you see UI improvements, make them.
Current features:
â€¢	Real-time lead display
â€¢	Status buttons (New/Contacted/Qualified)
â€¢	Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
Nice-to-haves:
â€¢	Filter by status
â€¢	Search by name/phone
â€¢	Export to CSV
Reference: dashboard.html has all the code.
 
Josh - Voice AI Integration
Task: Connect Twilio voice AI once MAG delivers the script.
Status: Waiting on script from MAG.
Reference: TROUBLESHOOTING.md â†’ "Next Steps" section.
