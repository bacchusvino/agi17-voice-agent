## **Risk Assessment**

### **ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk (Done)**
- Database âœ…
- Landing page âœ…
- Dashboard âœ…

### **ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk (In Progress)**
- N8N scraper - depends on Ismoil/Piyush
- Voice AI - new to everyone

### **Mitigation Plan:**
If scraping doesn't work â†’ Use manually entered sample data  
If voice AI doesn't work â†’ Show mockup/pre-recorded demo  

**Bottom line:** Even if parts fail, we have a working lead management system to demo.
