**Subject: 🎉 QualiFy MVP Status Update - We're 60% Done!**

Hey team! Quick update on QualiFy:

**🎯 THE GOOD NEWS:**

We have a working foundation! I just tested it and everything is solid:

✅ Landing page captures leads  
✅ Dashboard shows all leads in real-time  
✅ Database configured with security  
✅ Status updates work (qualified, contacted, etc.)  
✅ GitHub repo is organized and ready

**You can literally test it right now:** I'll demo on our next call.

**📋 WHAT'S LEFT (Super Clear Tasks):**

**Ismoil - Your Mission (3 days):**
Build N8N workflow that scrapes Craigslist San Diego FSBO listings and pushes them to our Supabase database.

- Target: 25+ leads by Friday
- I have the exact API endpoint ready for you
- See TEAM_REFERENCE.md in GitHub for full details

**MAG - Your Mission (2 days):**
Write the voice AI qualification script and recommend a platform (Bland.ai vs Vapi.ai).

- What questions should the AI ask sellers?
- How do we score leads (hot vs warm vs cold)?
- Document it in Google Docs

**Mihir:**
Dashboard is done! 🎉 Available if UI tweaks needed.

**Josh (me):**
Wire everything together once Ismoil and MAG deliver. Voice AI integration + testing.
