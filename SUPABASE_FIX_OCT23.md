# üî¥ CRITICAL FIX: Supabase URL Configuration Issue

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Fixed by:** Claude  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## The Problem

The landing page (`index.html`) had an **incorrect Supabase project reference** hardcoded, preventing proper database connectivity.

### Wrong URL (in code):
```
https://tyrwkeqavitw4fjfcnj.supabase.co
```

### Correct URL (should be):
```
https://tyrwkeqavitwkffjcznj.supabase.co
```

**Typo Details:**
- Wrong: `tyrwkeqavitw4fjfcnj` (has "4fj" instead of "kffj")
- Correct: `tyrwkeqavitwkffjcznj` (proper ref from Supabase dashboard)

---

## What Was Fixed

‚úÖ **index.html** (Line 483)
- Changed SUPABASE_URL to correct project reference
- Form submissions now route to correct database

‚úÖ **env.example** (Line 12)
- Updated example environment variable
- Developers will now copy correct URL for setup

---

## Files Status

### ‚úÖ Already Correct
- `agent-dashboard.html` - Uses placeholder `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` (will be replaced in deployment)
- `agent-signup.html` - Uses placeholder `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` (will be replaced in deployment)
- `dashboard.html` - Uses placeholder `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` (will be replaced in deployment)
- `add-sample-data.html` - Uses placeholder `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` (will be replaced in deployment)
- `dashboard_fixed.html` - Uses `config.js` import (proper approach)
- `config.example.js` - Uses placeholder (will be replaced in deployment)

### Why Placeholders Are OK
These files with placeholder values are meant to be replaced during deployment with actual credentials. The issue was that **index.html had the WRONG actual URL hardcoded**, which would cause immediate failures.
