## 🟡 IN PROGRESS

### Ismoil: Craigslist Scraper (n8n)
**Issue:** Got tangled in Zillow + Apify complexity  
**Fix Provided:** Simplified to Craigslist HTML parsing (no API keys needed)  
**Timeline:** 2 hrs to working version, 3 days to production-ready  
**Blockers:**  
- ❌ Zillow scraper too complicated (Apify requires enterprise setup)
- ✅ NEW: Craigslist path documented + template provided  
- Next: Test HTML parsing → Google Sheets → Supabase flow  
**Files:** `/n8n-workflows/ISMOIL_N8N_SETUP.md` + `qualify-craigslist-scraper.json`

### MAG: Voice AI Script + Platform Selection
**Status:** Not started (waiting on research)  
**Task:** Compare Bland.ai vs Vapi.ai for seller qualification calls  
**Deliverables Due:**  
- 1. Platform recommendation + API comparison
- 2. Qualification script (what AI asks, scoring criteria)
- 3. Sample call recording
**Timeline:** 2 days  

### Josh: Voice API → Dashboard Integration  
**Status:** Blocked on MAG's platform choice  
**Task:** Wire dashboard "Qualify Lead" button → voice API → webhook → Supabase update  
**Deliverables Due:**
- 1. API integration code
- 2. Webhook receiver for call results
- 3. Lead status auto-update logic
**Timeline:** 2 days after MAG delivers

## 🔴 NOT STARTED (But on schedule)

- Mandar: Agent auth credential generation
- Mihir: Voice agent testing + refinement

## 🚀 NEXT 24 HOURS

**Ismoil:**
1. Read `/n8n-workflows/ISMOIL_N8N_SETUP.md`
2. Start n8n locally
3. Copy workflow template from JSON file
4. Test first Craigslist scrape to Google Sheets
5. Slack screenshot of working workflow

**MAG:**
1. Research Bland.ai vs Vapi.ai (30 min)
2. Write qualification script draft (1 hr)
3. Share in team channel

**Josh:**
1. Prepare webhook receiver template (waiting on MAG)
2. Test Supabase REST API updates from different origins

**Mandar:**
1. Generate test credentials for agent login
2. Verify Supabase auth table structure

## 💡 Why We Ditched Zillow/Apify

**Original Plan:**
- Zillow listings → Apify scraper → Google Docs

**Problems:**
- Apify requires paid API keys ($$$)
- IP rotation complexity
- Blocking/CAPTCHA handling needed
- Extra layer of authentication
- Overkill for MVP

**New Plan:**
- Craigslist FSBO listings → n8n HTML parser → Google Sheets → Supabase

**Why it's better:**
- Craigslist allows scraping (no ToS violation)
- Free n8n self-hosted or cloud
- Simple HTML parsing (no special tools)
- Works in 2 hours, not 2 weeks
- MVP works today, scales easily

## 🎯 What "Done" Looks Like for Each Person

**Ismoil:** Slack shows screenshot of n8n workflow running, first 10 leads in Google Sheets + dashboard

**MAG:** Slack message with platform recommendation + script (copy-pasteable for Josh)

**Josh:** Slack shows voice API call triggered from dashboard, lead status updates automatically

**Mandar:** Agent login page accepts credentials, routes to agent-specific dashboard

**Mihir:** Voice capture working on agent dashboard

**Zubair:** Full system test: lead scraped → shown in dashboard → agent calls → result recorded

## ⚠️ Demo Risks (Mitigated)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Craigslist blocks scraper | Switch to FSBO.com backup (similar HTML) |
| Voice API down on demo day | Pre-record sample call, show in video |
| Supabase connection fails | Have local test data ready |
| N8N crashes mid-demo | Run workflow before, show screenshots |

## 📞 Communication Plan

**Daily standup:** 10am PST (all team)  
**Status updates:** Slack #aig17-qualify channel  
**Blockers:** DM or mention in channel immediately  
**Demo prep:** Starting Nov 15 (intensive testing week)
