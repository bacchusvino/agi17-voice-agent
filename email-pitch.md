**Email Body:**

Hi [AGENT_NAME],

Quick question: How much commission did you pay to Zillow last year?

If you're like most San Diego agents, it was probably $10,000-$15,000 per deal (or more). 

What if I told you there's a way to generate your own qualified leads from San Diego's FSBO market - and respond to them faster than any other agent?

**Here's how it works:**

✓ AI monitors local FSBO sites, Craigslist, Facebook, Instagram  
✓ Calls new leads within 5 minutes with natural conversation  
✓ Qualifies timeline, motivation, and budget automatically  
✓ Sends personalized video follow-up with YOUR face and voice  

**Real results from San Diego agents:**
- Maria R. (Mission Valley): 3 new listings in first month
- David C. (Del Mar): Secured $2.1M listing while showing another property  
- Jennifer P. (Scripps Ranch): First to respond to FSBO, won the listing

The best part? It costs $297/month total. Compare that to one Zillow lead fee.

**Want to see it in action?**

I can show you exactly how this works with a quick 15-minute demo. You'll see real San Diego FSBO leads being captured and qualified in real-time.

Either way, you'll see why agents are saying this is the biggest game-changer since MLS.

P.S. We're only accepting 50 San Diego agents in our beta program. Once we hit that number, there's a waiting list. Don't miss out on keeping 100% of your commission.

**Follow-up Email (3 days later):**

Hi [AGENT_NAME],

I sent you a note about QualiFy a few days ago - the AI system that's helping San Diego agents capture and qualify FSBO leads automatically.

I wanted to follow up because I just got off a call with Jennifer, an agent in Scripps Ranch. She told me something that perfectly illustrates why this works so well:

*"QualiFy caught a listing 3 minutes after it was posted on Craigslist. I had the appointment booked before other agents even saw it. The AI qualification call was so natural, the seller thought it was my assistant."*

That's the power of responding in minutes instead of hours.

If you're curious how this could work for your business, I'm happy to show you a quick demo. No pressure - just a chance to see if this makes sense for your market area.
