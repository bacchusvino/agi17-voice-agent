## 🚀 TEST THIS NOW (Next 5 Minutes)

Open two terminals:

**Terminal 1: Start local server**
```bash
cd /Users/joschapirtle/agi17-voice-agent
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

## 🎯 What's Left to Build (MVP)

### Priority 1: Ismoil - N8N Scraper (3 Days)
**Status:** Not started  
**Task:** Build Craigslist → Supabase pipeline

**Steps:**
1. Set up N8N instance
2. Create workflow:
   - HTTP GET to Craigslist San Diego FSBO
   - Parse HTML (name, phone, address, price)
   - POST to Supabase REST API
3. Schedule every 6 hours
4. Test with 10+ leads

**Endpoint to use:**
```
POST https://tyrwkeqavitwkffjcznj.supabase.co/rest/v1/leads
Headers:
  apikey: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InR5cndrZXFhdml0d2tmZmpjem5qIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTg5OTA5MzcsImV4cCI6MjA3NDU2NjkzN30.XlP3j-5SQjje7nfv2jvtccQMJtlbSI22vqQtfEj7Nc4
  Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "619-555-1234",
  "address": "123 Main St, San Diego",
  "price": 500000,
  "source": "craigslist",
  "city": "San Diego"
}
```

### Priority 2: MAG - Voice AI Script (2 Days)
**Status:** Not started  
**Task:** Write qualification script + choose platform

**Deliverables:**
1. Research doc comparing Bland.ai vs Vapi.ai
2. Qualification script (what AI asks sellers)
3. Scoring criteria (what makes a "hot" lead)

**Script Template (MAG to refine):**
```
Opening: "Hi, I'm calling about your property at [ADDRESS]..."

Questions:
1. Confirm FSBO status
2. Timeline for selling
3. Current price/flexibility  
4. Agent experience
5. Open to representation?

Scoring:
- Hot Lead: 80-100 (ready now, open to agent)
- Warm: 50-79 (selling soon, maybe agent)
- Cold: 0-49 (not ready or not interested)
```

### Priority 3: Josh - Voice AI Integration (2 Days)
**Status:** Waiting on MAG's platform choice  
**Task:** Connect dashboard → Voice AI → Supabase

**What you'll build:**
1. "Qualify Lead" button triggers API call
2. Bland.ai/Vapi.ai makes the call
3. Webhook receives results
4. Update lead status in Supabase

**Code stub (once MAG picks platform):**
```javascript
async function qualifyLead(leadId, phoneNumber) {
  // Call voice AI API
  const response = await fetch('https://api.bland.ai/v1/calls', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      phone_number: phoneNumber,
      task: "Qualify FSBO seller",
      webhook: "https://your-webhook-url.com/results"
    })
  });
  
  // Update lead status to "contacted"
  await supabaseClient
    .from('leads')
    .update({ call_status: 'pending' })
    .eq('id', leadId);
}
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

**None!** Everything tested is working.

**Potential Issues:**
- If form doesn't save: Check browser console for CORS errors
- If dashboard is empty: Check Supabase RLS policies
- If N8N can't connect: May need service role key instead of anon key

## 🎓 For Future Reference

### Supabase REST API Examples

**Insert a lead (what N8N will do):**
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://tyrwkeqavitwkffjcznj.supabase.co/rest/v1/leads' \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "phone": "858-555-9999",
    "address": "456 Oak Ave, San Diego",
    "price": 750000,
    "source": "craigslist"
  }'
```

**Get all leads:**
```bash
curl 'https://tyrwkeqavitwkffjcznj.supabase.co/rest/v1/leads?select=*' \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY"
```

**Update lead status:**
```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://tyrwkeqavitwkffjcznj.supabase.co/rest/v1/leads?id=eq.LEAD_ID' \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "qualified"}'
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't overthink it** - We have a working system NOW. Ismoil and MAG just need to plug into it.

2. **The hard parts are done** - Database, auth, RLS, UI are all solid. The remaining work is straightforward integration.

3. **Demo early, demo often** - Even without N8N/Voice AI, you can manually add test leads and show the dashboard working.

4. **Keep the team aligned** - Daily 15-min standups prevent confusion.

---

## 🚨 If Something Breaks

**Landing page form not saving:**
```javascript
// Check browser console (F12)
// Look for errors related to Supabase

// Common fix: Clear browser cache
// Or: Check Supabase project is not paused
```

**Dashboard not loading:**
```javascript
// Check: Are you on http://localhost:8000?
// Check: Browser console for errors
// Check: Supabase credentials are correct
```

**Need help?**
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Check Supabase logs (supabase.com → your project → logs)
3. Ask in team channel with screenshot

---

## ✨ Bottom Line

**We're ahead of schedule!** The core platform works. Now we just need:
1. Ismoil to feed it leads (N8N)
2. MAG to define how to qualify them (Voice script)
3. Josh to wire them together (API integration)

**Friday's demo will be killer.** Let's go! 🚀
