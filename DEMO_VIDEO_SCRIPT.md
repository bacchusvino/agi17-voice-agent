### **SECTION 1: The Problem (20 seconds)**

**[Screen: Show Zillow pricing page or generic "40% commission" graphic]**

**Voiceover:**
> "Real estate agents in San Diego are frustrated. They're paying 40% to platforms like Zillow for leads, spending 10-15 hours per week manually qualifying them, and losing deals to slow follow-up. We built a better way."

**[Text overlay: "40% fees | 15 hrs/week wasted | Slow follow-up"]**

### **SECTION 2: The Solution (25 seconds)**

**[Screen: Simple diagram or animation showing the flow]**

**Voiceover:**

2. **Problem (15s):** "Agents waste time and money on leads"
3. **Solution (15s):** "We automate capture, qualify, book"
4. **Demo (40s):** "Here's the dashboard in action"
5. **Outro (10s):** "Check out our repo, thanks!"

## **When to Record**

**Ideal Timeline:**
- **Week 2:** Record voice AI mockup version (before it's fully working)
- **Week 3:** Record full working version (once MAG delivers voice AI)
- **Week 4:** Final edit and submission

**Recommendation:** Record a rough version in Week 2 so you have a backup. If everything works perfectly by Week 3, re-record the full version.

## **Next Steps**
