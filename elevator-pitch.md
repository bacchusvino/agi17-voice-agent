# QualiFy Elevator Pitch

**Version 1 (Direct & Problem-Focused):**
"QualiFy helps San Diego real estate agents stop losing 40% of their commission to Zillow leads. Our AI captures local FSBO leads, qualifies them with natural phone calls within 5 minutes, and sends personalized video follow-ups that win listings. Agents typically save $15,000+ per deal while closing 3x more listings per month."

**Version 2 (Benefit-Focused):**
"QualiFy is like having a 24/7 assistant that finds San Diego FSBO leads, calls them immediately to qualify their needs, and sends professional video follow-ups with your face and voice. Real estate agents use it to keep 100% of their commission instead of paying Zillow's 35-40% fees while actually closing more deals."

**Version 3 (Story-Driven):**
"You know how real estate agents either pay Zillow huge fees for leads or miss out on FSBO opportunities because they can't respond fast enough? QualiFy solves both problems with AI that captures San Diego leads instantly, qualifies them with natural phone calls, and sends personalized videos that win listings. Our agents save $15K+ per deal and close 3x more listings."
