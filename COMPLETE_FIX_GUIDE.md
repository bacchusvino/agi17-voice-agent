# 🎯 AGI-17 QualiFy - COMPLETE FIX & DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

**Project:** Real Estate Lead Generation with Voice Agent  
**Team Lead:** Joscha Pirtle  
**Team:** Mandar, Mihir, Ismoil, Zubair  
**Demo Date:** November 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

---

## 🔴 THE CRITICAL BUG (FIXED)

### Problem
The landing page form couldn't save leads because the Supabase URL was **typo'd** in the code.

**Wrong URL (was deployed):**
```
https://tyrwkeqavitw4fjfcnj.supabase.co  ❌
```

**Correct URL (now deployed):**
```
https://tyrwkeqavitwkffjcznj.supabase.co  ✅
```

### Root Cause
Typo in project reference: `4fj` instead of `kffj`
- Character 4 should not be there
- This caused all form submissions to fail with database connection errors

---

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### Files Modified (3):
1. **index.html** (line 702)
   - Updated `SUPABASE_URL` constant with correct project reference
   - Form submission handler now routes to correct database

2. **env.example** (line 12)
   - Updated example environment variable
   - Developers will copy correct URL for local setup

3. **Deploy Scripts Created (3):**
   - `RUN_DEPLOYMENT.sh` - One-command deployment
   - `deploy.sh` - Interactive deployment script
   - Comprehensive documentation

### Documentation Added (3):
1. **DEPLOYMENT_READY_OCT23.md** - Full deployment guide
2. **SUPABASE_FIX_OCT23.md** - Technical fix details
3. **TEAM_STATUS_OCT23.md** - Team checklist

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & RESOLUTION

### Issue: "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED"
**What it is:** Google Analytics tracking pixels failing (not critical)  
**Impact:** None - form still works  
**Solution:** Can be ignored or removed from HTML later

### Issue: Form doesn't submit
**Likely cause:** Browser hasn't refreshed after Netlify deploy  
**Solution:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Data doesn't appear in Supabase
**Likely cause:** Deployment not complete or form validation error  
**Solution:** Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Issue: CORS errors
**Likely cause:** Netlify domain not whitelisted  
**Solution:** Check Supabase project settings → API
