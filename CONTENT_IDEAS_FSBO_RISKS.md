# Content Ideas: Why FSBO Sellers Need an Agent

## Section: "The Hidden Risks of Selling Without an Agent"

### 1. **Title Fraud is Real**
> "Last year, someone listed a property for sale that they didn't even own. The real owner (a 50-year realtor) discovered it by accident. Title theft is on the rise, and protecting yourself requires expertise."

**CTA:** "Protect your biggest asset. Talk to a pro."

### 2. **Paperwork Nightmares**
- 80+ pages of legal documents
- One mistake can void the sale or expose you to lawsuits
- Disclosure requirements vary by city/county

### 3. **Inspections & Negotiations**
- Buyers will find issues (they always do)
- How do you negotiate repairs without killing the deal?
- Agents know what's normal vs. dealbreaker

### 4. **Pricing It Wrong Costs You**
- Too high = sits on market, becomes "stale listing"
- Too low = you leave $50k+ on the table
- Agents have comps, data, market knowledge

### 5. **Time is Money**
- Average FSBO takes 6+ months to sell
- Agent-listed homes sell in 30-60 days
- Can you afford to wait?
