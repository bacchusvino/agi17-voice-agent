## **Objection Handling**

### **Objection: "I don't want to pay 6% commission"**
**Response:**
```
"I totally get that! Most agents are flexible on commission, especially for motivated sellers. 
Plus, they often get you 10-15% more than FSBO sales, which covers the commission and then some. 
Would you be open to hearing how they structure their fees?"
```

---

### **Objection: "I'm already working with someone"**
**Response:**
```
"That's great! Are you happy with the results so far?"
[If NO] ‚Üí "Would you be open to a second opinion? No obligation."
[If YES] ‚Üí "Awesome! Best of luck with your sale."
```

---

### **Objection: "I'm not interested in phone calls"**
**Response:**
```
"No problem! Would you prefer a quick text message intro instead? 
Or I can just send you some helpful FSBO tips via email."
```

  call_transcript: [full transcript],
  qualification_score: [0-100],
  timeline: ['immediate'|'1-3 months'|'3-6 months'|'6+ months'],
  motivation: [text],
  agent_experience: [true|false],
  interested_in_agent: [true|false],
  notes: [key insights from call],
  contacted_at: [timestamp],
  status: ['qualified'|'contacted'|'not_interested']
}
```
