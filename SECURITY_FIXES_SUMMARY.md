# Security Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the AGI17 Voice Agent application.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Config.js Security (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: Production Supabase URL and anon key were committed to git
- **Status**: Already resolved - config.js is in .gitignore and file doesn't exist
- **Recommendation**: Continue using environment variables for all sensitive data

### 2. ✅ Google Sheets Defensive Programming
- **Issue**: `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` could be undefined, causing TypeError
- **Fix**: Added defensive check: `(process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY || '').replace(/\\n/g, '\n')`
- **Added**: Environment variable validation at startup with clear error messages

### 3. ✅ Google Sheets Error Handling
- **Issue**: No try-catch, validation, timeout, or retry logic
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling:
  - Try-catch blocks with detailed logging
  - 5-second timeout with Promise.race
  - Exponential backoff retry (3 attempts)
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - CSV injection prevention

### 4. ✅ Server Error Exposure
- **Issue**: Error messages exposed internal implementation details
- **Fix**: 
  - Return generic error to client: `{ ok: false, error: 'Unable to process request' }`
  - Log full error server-side with request ID for debugging
  - Added request ID tracking for better debugging

### 5. ✅ Server Validation & Rate Limiting
- **Issue**: No validation middleware, rate limiting, or CORS restrictions
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive security middleware:
  - **Rate limiting**: 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP
  - **CORS**: Restricted to specific origins
  - **Helmet**: Security headers
  - **Body size limit**: 10kb maximum
  - **Input validation**: Email regex, phone E.164 format, length limits
  - **CSV injection prevention**: Strip leading `= + - @` characters

### 6. ✅ Client Status Logic
- **Issue**: Client hardcoded `status: 'new'` in database insert
- **Fix**: Removed hardcoded status, let database default handle it
- **Benefit**: Backend owns data model, easier to maintain

### 7. ✅ Dashboard XSS Vulnerability
- **Issue**: Lead ID interpolated directly into onclick attributes
- **Fix**: 
  - Replaced onclick attributes with data attributes
  - Added event delegation with `addEventListener`
  - Prevents attribute injection/XSS attacks

### 8. ✅ Dashboard FAQ Bug
- **Issue**: `window.toggleFaq` referenced non-existent function
- **Status**: Function reference not found in current codebase (likely already resolved)

### 9. ✅ RLS Policy Security
- **Issue**: Overly permissive RLS policy with no rate limiting
- **Fix**: Created new migration with:
  - **Input validation**: Length limits and required fields
  - **Duplicate prevention**: Same email/phone within 1 hour
  - **Better error messages**: Clear feedback for validation failures
  - **Application-level rate limiting**: Already implemented in server.js

## New Dependencies Added
- `express-rate-limit`: Rate limiting middleware
- `helmet`: Security headers middleware

## Security Improvements Summary

### Backend Security
- ✅ Rate limiting (10 requests/15min per IP)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ CORS restrictions to specific origins
- ✅ Security headers via Helmet
- ✅ Request size limits (10kb)
- ✅ Error message sanitization
- ✅ Comprehensive logging with request IDs

### Database Security
- ✅ Improved RLS policies with validation
- ✅ Duplicate submission prevention
- ✅ Input length validation at database level
- ✅ Better error handling for validation failures

### Frontend Security
- ✅ XSS prevention in dashboard
- ✅ Removed hardcoded status from client
- ✅ Event delegation instead of inline handlers

### Google Sheets Integration
- ✅ Defensive programming for environment variables
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with retries
- ✅ Timeout protection (5 seconds)
- ✅ CSV injection prevention
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Update CORS origins** in server.js with your actual domain names
2. **Rotate Supabase keys** if they were ever exposed
3. **Monitor rate limiting** and adjust limits based on usage
4. **Set up logging** for production error tracking
5. **Regular security audits** of dependencies and configurations

## Files Modified
- `utils/sheets.js` - Added defensive programming and error handling
- `server.js` - Added security middleware and validation
- `package.json` - Added security dependencies
- `index.html` - Removed hardcoded status
- `dashboard.html` - Fixed XSS vulnerability
- `supabase/migrations/20250108_improve_rls_security.sql` - New security migration

All security vulnerabilities have been addressed with comprehensive fixes and improvements.
