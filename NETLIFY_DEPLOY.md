## ‚úÖ What Gets Deployed

The following files are deployed as a static site:
- `index.html` - Landing page with lead capture form
- `dashboard.html` - Lead management dashboard
- All assets load directly from HTML (no build step needed)

## üîß Configuration

The `netlify.toml` file is configured for:
- Static site deployment (no build process)
- Root directory publishing
- SPA redirect handling (if needed later)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Connection

Both pages connect directly to Supabase:
- **URL:** `https://tyrwkeqavitwkffjcznj.supabase.co`
- **API Key:** Already embedded in HTML files
- **Method:** Direct REST API calls (no backend needed)

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue: 404 Error on Form Submit
**Cause:** Old cached version trying to hit `/api/submit-lead`  
**Fix:**
1. Clear Netlify deploy cache: Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Clear cache
2. Trigger new deploy
3. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Form Submits But Shows Error
**Check:**
1. Browser console (F12) for actual error
2. Netlify function logs (if you accidentally have functions)
3. Supabase RLS policies are enabled

### Issue: Dashboard Doesn't Load Leads
**Check:**
1. Supabase credentials match in both `index.html` and `dashboard.html`
2. RLS policies allow SELECT for anon role
3. Browser console for CORS or auth errors
