---

## **What's Working Right Now**

✅ **Full Lead Capture Pipeline:**
```
Landing Page Form → Supabase Database → Dashboard Display
```

✅ **Core Features:**
- Lead submission
- Data persistence
- Real-time dashboard
- Statistics calculation
- Filter UI (needs testing)

---

## **What Needs Testing**

🟡 **Status Update Buttons**
- Need to click green ✓ button and verify lead changes to "Qualified"
- Need to click yellow 📞 button and verify lead changes to "Contacted"
- Need to click red ✕ button and verify lead changes to "Not Interested"

🟡 **Dashboard Filters**
- Test "Status" dropdown
- Test "Source" dropdown
- Test search box

---

## **What Needs Building**

❌ **N8N Workflow** (Ismoil/Piyush)
- Scrape Craigslist FSBO listings
- Parse: name, phone, email, address, price
- Push to Supabase `leads` table
- Tag with `source: 'craigslist'`

❌ **Voice AI Integration** (MAG)
- Set up Vapi.ai or Bland.ai account
- Configure script from VOICE_AI_SCRIPT.md
- Connect webhook to Supabase
- Test with Josh's phone number

---

## **Demo Day Readiness**

### **Ready Now (Week 1):**
✅ Landing page with form capture  
✅ Dashboard showing leads  
✅ Database architecture  
✅ Project documentation  

### **Needed by Week 2:**
- [ ] N8N scraper pulling real FSBO data
- [ ] At least 20 real leads in database

### **Needed by Week 3:**
- [ ] Voice AI making test calls
- [ ] Call transcripts saving to database
- [ ] Qualification scoring working

### **Needed by Week 4:**
- [ ] 2-3 minute demo video
- [ ] Full end-to-end flow working
- [ ] Team presentation prepared

---

## **Risk Assessment**

### **🟢 Low Risk**
- Landing page ✅
- Dashboard ✅
- Database ✅

### **🟡 Medium Risk**
- N8N scraper (depends on Ismoil/Piyush delivery)
- Voice AI integration (depends on MAG and platform choice)

### **🔴 High Risk**
- Voice AI may not work as expected (new to everyone)
- Scraping may get blocked (Cloudflare, rate limits)
- Team coordination (people not showing up)

---

## **Mitigation Plan**

If voice AI doesn't work:
- Use pre-recorded "demo" calls
- Show mockup of what it would do
- Focus on the data pipeline and dashboard

If scraping doesn't work:
- Use manually entered sample data
- Show CSV import instead of live scraping
- Demonstrate the concept vs. live implementation

If team doesn't deliver:
- Josh can complete basic versions himself
- Focus on the working pieces (landing + dashboard)
- Honest demo: "This works, this is in progress"

---

## **Recommendations**

### **Immediate (This Week):**
1. ✅ Test status update buttons on dashboard
2. ✅ Test all filters and search
3. 📧 Send VOICE_AI_SCRIPT.md to MAG
4. 📧 Confirm Ismoil/Piyush timeline for N8N scraper

### **Next Week:**
1. Get first scraped leads into database
2. MAG sets up voice AI platform
3. Run first test voice call
4. Start drafting demo video script

### **Week 3:**
1. Full system integration test
2. Record demo footage
3. Prepare team presentation

### **Week 4:**
1. Final testing
2. Edit demo video
3. Rehearse presentation
4. Submit project

---

## **Bottom Line**

**System is 40% complete and fully functional for what's built.**

The hard infrastructure work is done:
- ✅ Database designed and working
- ✅ Frontend built and responsive
- ✅ Core data flow operational

What remains is **integration work** that depends on teammates:
- N8N scraping (Ismoil/Piyush)
- Voice AI (MAG)

**Verdict:** On track for demo day if team delivers their pieces by Week 2.

---

**Next Action:** Commit all changes to GitHub and send team update.
