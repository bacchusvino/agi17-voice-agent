# Agent Onboarding Page - Ideas

## Two Options:

### Option A: Add "For Agents" Section to Current Landing Page
Add a new section after Hero that targets agents specifically:

**Section: "For Real Estate Agents"**
- Headline: "Stop Paying 40% to Zillow. Get Qualified FSBO Leads for Free."
- Sub: "We find them, call them, qualify them. You close them."
- CTA: "Join as an Agent Partner"

### Option B: Separate Agent Landing Page  
Create `agents.html` with:

**Hero:**
"San Diego Agents: Own Your Pipeline"

**Benefits:**
- No upfront cost
- Only pay per closed deal
- Pre-qualified FSBO sellers
- We handle all the follow-up

**How It Works:**
1. We scrape Craigslist/Facebook for FSBO listings
2. Our AI calls and qualifies them
3. Hot leads delivered to your calendar
4. You close the deal

**Pricing:**
- Free to join
- Pay 3-5% referral fee on closed deals
- Or flat fee per qualified lead ($50-100)

## Your Business Model Question:

**Do you charge:**
- Agents (for qualified leads)?
- Sellers (for the service)?
- Both?

**Most likely:** Charge agents, service is "free" for sellers.

1. Decide on business model
2. Add "For Agents" nav link
3. Create agent signup form
4. Different database table or just a field?
