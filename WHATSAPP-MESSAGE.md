**🚨 AIG-17 Update - Landing Page Fixes Complete**

Hey everyone! Just wrapped up some critical fixes on the QualiFy landing page:

✅ **What Got Fixed:**
- Hero section text visibility (was gray on purple - basically invisible)
- FAQ accordion toggles now work properly
- Improved font rendering for better readability across browsers
- Button contrast issues resolved

⚠️ **URGENT - Need Someone to Step Up:**

We have a "Watch 60-sec Demo" button prominently displayed on the landing page, but **we don't actually have a demo video yet**.

**We Need:**
Someone to record a 60-second demo video showing QualiFy in action before our Nov 23 demo.

**Options if no one can do video:**
1. Change button to "See Social Proof" or "View Results"
2. Remove the button temporarily
3. Link it to something else we already have

**Can anyone in the group take ownership of this?** Even if you're not on the core dev team (Mandar, Mihir, Ismoil, Zubair), we could use help here.

Reply ASAP so we can coordinate before demo day.

**Shorter/Urgent Version:**

🚨 Landing page bugs fixed (text visibility + FAQ).

**URGENT:** "Watch 60-sec Demo" button is live but we have NO VIDEO. 

Demo day = Nov 23. Can ANYONE in the group record a 60-sec product demo? Or should we remove the button?

Need someone to own this ASAP. Who's in?
