**üö® AIG-17 Update - Landing Page Fixes**

Hey team! Just fixed some critical issues on the QualiFy landing page:

‚úÖ **Fixed:**
- Text visibility on hero section (was nearly invisible)
- FAQ accordion now works properly
- Better font rendering across all browsers

‚ö†Ô∏è **URGENT - Need Action:**
We have a "Watch 60-sec Demo" button on the site, but **we don't have an actual demo video yet**. 

**Options:**
1. Someone record a quick 60-sec demo ASAP
2. Change the button text to something else
3. Remove it until we have the video

Demo is Nov 23 - we need to decide on this before launch.

Who can take ownership of the demo video?

**Full details:** See `FIXES-OCT-12-2025.md` in the repo

üö® Fixed landing page text visibility + FAQ bugs. 

**URGENT:** "Watch 60-sec Demo" button exists but we have NO VIDEO. Need someone to own this before Nov 23 demo. Who's on it?
